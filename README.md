 Voting System
Project Overview

The Voting System is a Java-based application that simulates a real-world voting process.
It allows users to register as voters, log in securely, and cast their vote.
An admin can manage candidates and view the final election results.

This project is designed to understand the basics of Java programming, object-oriented concepts, and menu-driven applications.

 Individual Contribution

I developed this project independently.
I designed the program flow, implemented voter and admin functionalities, handled vote validation, and tested the application to ensure correct results.

 Conclusion

The Voting System project helped me understand how real-life systems can be converted into software applications.
Through this project, I improved my Java programming skills and gained confidence in building logical and structured programs.
